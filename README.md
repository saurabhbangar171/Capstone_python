Welcome to my profile portfolio project of python where project is a hands-on demonstration of Python and data analysis fundamentals using Pandas and NumPy, involving processing and analyzing employee and project-related data through various tasks designed to test core programming and data manipulation skills.

Capstone python solution set.ipynb - Contains all the code solutions with outputs and comments.

Employee.csv, Seniority.csv, Project.csv - CSV files created and used for analysis.

**Data Frames:**
The project works with three main DataFrames:

Employee DataFrame: 
ID, Name, Gender, City, Age

Seniority Level DataFrame: 
ID, Designation Level

Project DataFrame: 
ID, Project, Cost, Status

**Task Overview:**
1 Create 3 DataFrames and save them as .csv

2	Replace missing project costs using running average (with a for loop)

3	Split full names into First Name and Last Name

4	Merge all three DataFrames into one called Final

5	Add 5% bonus to employees with finished projects

6	Demote employees with failed projects, remove if designation > 4

7	Prefix Mr./Mrs. to names, drop Gender column

8	Promote designation level by 1 for employees aged > 29

9	Create TotalProjCost DataFrame with total cost per employee

10	Filter employees with "o" in their city name

**Technologies Used:**
Python, 
Jupyter Notebook, 
Pandas, 
NumPy.


This project evaluates data handling using real-world-like scenarios, focusing on:

Data cleaning

Transformation and merging

Logical conditions and loops

Using pandas for data manipulation
